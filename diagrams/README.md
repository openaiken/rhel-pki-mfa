# Diagrams

I included a full diagram of the Authentication Flow. There is a PNG image, a PDF (it's one very long page so it may be difficult to print), and an XML formatted `.drawio` file, representing the original source, which you can import into https://draw.io and modify to meet your needs in case you customize this code for your organization and need a new, accurate diagram.
